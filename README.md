A simple Single Page Application (SPA) project featuring an Engineering blog with my personal course writings involving topics around Generative AI and Ethical Engineering.

You can access the site at: https://anchals7.github.io/SinglePageApplication/

This SPA is coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page content is updated dynamically using JavaScript based on the selected toolbar menu option.

As an engineering student, I am highly passionate about the applications of my field in various industries and realize that it is essential to discuss impacts and consequences as much as we highlight the benefits. The writings featured in this blog are from my engineering writing course at USC (WRIT 340) and touch on these topics.

Happy Reading!
